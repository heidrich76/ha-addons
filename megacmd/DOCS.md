## Sensors

If a local MQTT broker is running on your Home Assistant instance, the add-on automatically creates a virtual device `MEGA Cloud` with two sensors:

- **Cloud Debris Size**: Size (MB) of the trash folder in MEGA cloud storage
- **Local Debris Size**: Size (MB) of local trash folders in synchronized directories

## MQTT Control

You can control the add-on via MQTT by sending the following commands:

- **Clean cloud trash:**

  ```yaml
  action: mqtt.publish
  data:
    topic: "megacmd/command"
    payload: "clean_cloud_debris"
  ```

- **Clean local trash:**

  ```yaml
  action: mqtt.publish
  data:
    topic: "megacmd/command"
    payload: "clean_local_debris"
  ```
