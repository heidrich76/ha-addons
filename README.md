# Home Assistant Add-ons: Jens' repository

Home Assistant is an open-source platform for automating and controlling smart home devices locally and securely from a central interface.

[![Home Assistant - A project from the Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/badges/home-assistant.png)](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/)

[Add-ons for Home Assistant](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons) allow you to extend the functionality of your Home Assistant setup.
These add-ons can include applications or provide access to your Home Assistant configuration. Add-ons can be installed and configured via the Home Assistant frontend on systems that have Home Assistant installed.

Home Assistant comes with an official [add-on repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/), but also allows extending the set of available add-ons through custom repositories.
